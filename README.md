## Introduction

The Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT) is a critical component in many embedded systems, providing precise timing and interrupt capabilities. This repository demonstrates a complete Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design flow for a PIT, from high-level RTL design to the final physical layout.

## Features

- **RTL Design:** Verilog-based RTL implementation of the PIT.
- **Synthesis:** Conversion of RTL code to gate-level representation.
- **Simulation:** Functional and timing simulations to verify correctness.
- **Verification:** Comprehensive testbenches and verification environment.
- **Physical Design:** Floorplanning, placement, routing, and sign-off checks.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and tutorials.
